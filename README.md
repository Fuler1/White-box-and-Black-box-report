# White-box and Black-box-report
I made full black-box and white-box report
The tested WordPress application demonstrates a high level of security.
No critical or high risk vulnerabilities were identified that would allow system compromise, unathorized database access, or administrative accout takeover.
The application correctly enforces backend business logic, does not trust client-side input for security decisions, and effectively prevents abuse of the reservation workflow.
The only identified risk relates to semantic unput validation, which may impact data integrity and introduce secondary risks in administrative contexts.
